## What is this?
This is a machine learning predictor for NBA games.

## Data
We built a scraper to get data from [Basketball Reference](https://basketball-reference.com).

## How did we do it?
We tested with a variety of different models, ranging from a simple baseline predictor which just predicts each game
based off of the current win percentage of each team to models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM.

## Results
Best test accuracy was 74.3% from SVM so far, compared to 69% from the baseline predictor.
