## What is this?
This is a machine learning predictor for NBA games.

## Data
We built a scraper to get data from [Basketball Reference](https://basketball-reference.com).

## How did we do it?
We tested with a variety of different models, ranging from a simple baseline predictor which just predicts each game
based off of the current win percentage of each team (great win percentage is predicted the winner) to models such as
Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM.

## Feature Summary
* Winning Percentage
* Home Record
* Away Record

## Results
Coming soon.
